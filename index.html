              Literature Review
            </h4>
            <p class="content-block__paragraph1">
              A review of the literature was carried out to assess and contrast the currently available solutions in relation to the suggested solution. In the aspect of demographics identification and facial feature detection, research [4] highlights the potential of deep learning-based skin image analysis algorithms to enhance diagnostic accuracy and alleviate dermatologists' workload. While studies have explored acne diagnosis using deep learning algorithms, varying success rates have been observed. In [5] leverage AI driven face recognition to diagnose diseases through facial phenotypes, achieving a combined sensitivity and specificity of 89% and 92%, respectively. Their introduction of "facial recognition intensity" introduces a new dimension to enhance accuracy. Furthermore, studies have delved into facial image classification, comparing techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNN) and support vector machines (SVM). Notably, this research [7] stands out for its ability to predict age and gender accurately, even with limited training data. Additionally, the comparison of facial image categorization algorithms [8] emphasizes the efficacy of predetermined algorithms and their implications. In [9] presents a MobileNet v2-based method for detecting various skin diseases, achieving impressive accuracy rates. In the aspect of hair features detection, the research "ScalpEye for Scalp Health" [10] introduces ScalpEye, a deep learning-based system by Chang et al. sUsing ResNet and v2 Atrous Faster R-CNN models, it achieves accurate recognition (97.41%-99.09% precision) of four scalp hair signs, with potential enhancements planned, including more symptoms and larger sample sizes. In "SRoy and Protity [11]," a machine learning model predicts hair and scalp disorders (e.g., alopecia, folliculitis, psoriasis) with 96.2% training precision and 91.1% validation precision. The approach aids early identification and treatment of common hair and scalp issues. The study by Ibrahim et al.[12] presents a pre-trained scalp condition classification method using image processing. Employing SVM, they categorized disorders via enhanced images, color/texture/shape features extraction, and edge detection, achieving scalp condition classification through extracted features. Comparing these studies, it's evident that the proposed solution in the literature review focuses on hair and scalp disease detection, particularly utilizing deep learning and image processing techniques. The ScalpEye system [10] stands out due to its accurate recognition of hair signs and its subsequent use in the ScalpEye system for diagnosis. The results demonstrated a high degree of accuracy in detecting scalp conditions. Additionally, this section of the study offers a solution to the issue by using machine learning techniques to examine hair samples using data from mobile camera inputs. The accuracy and viability of such systems have not yet been thoroughly studied. The system's planned future improvements highlight the commitment to enhancing accuracy and scope. In the aspect of skin features detection, [13] demonstrates the potential of pretrained CNN AlexNet in conjunction with SVM, achieving a remarkable 100% accuracy for three skin disease types, albeit with a limited training dataset. In [14] delve into image color and texture features, employing methods like image segmentation, Euclidean distance transformation, and GLCM-based feature extraction, resulting in 85%, 90%, and 95% accuracy for identifying three specific skin diseases.It is [15] emphasizes a fusion of classical machine learning and deep CNNs, training on a dataset of 10,000 images to achieve 95% accuracy in classifying six types of skin lesions. In [16] proposes a mobile-based skin disease detection method utilizing TensorFlow and Keras, capable of identifying seven skin disease types with 87% accuracy. Srinivasu et al. [17] integrate MobileNet V2 and LSTM for skin disease classification, achieving 85.34% accuracy across seven lesion types using a texture-based approach.

Those who are always with a busy schedule may not have the time to take good care of their skin, hair, and other body components, which can have a negative impact on their general health and look.Lack of time may prompt individuals to look for quick and easy cosmetic solutions, such as the use of shoddy or improper cosmetic health products.This could exacerbate existing troublesome skin and hair, leading to pimples, dryness, irritability, and other issues.In light of this, it's essential that consumers select health care cosmetics that are suitable for their individual needs, such as their skin type, hair type, and any potential underlying medical conditions.They should also give priority to choosing products created from premium, natural materials and steer clear of those that contain harsh chemicals or other potentially dangerous compounds.People need to take care of themselves both inside and out, despite having busy schedules. They may keep healthy and vibrant skin, hair, and overall wellbeing by properly managing their time and using the best health care cosmetic items.By evaluating facial, hair, and skin image data to extract pertinent traits and information that would influence product suggestions, the project intends to establish an effective, accurate, and practical method of product selection for consumers. To gather information on customers' experiences choosing cosmetic products and how a customized recommendation system might enhance their purchasing experience, the study may involve conducting surveys and conducting interviews with a sample group of consumers. The research methodology could entail developing and putting into use computer vision and machine learning algorithms to analyze facial, hair, and skin features and provide recommendations depending on the individual's particular traits. Through user testing and comparison with more conventional techniques of product selection, the system's efficacy and accuracy could be assessed. The study's conclusions may aid in the creation of a cutting-edge cosmetics sector that offers customized product suggestions that take into account individuals' particular skin and facial traits.

              Methodology
            </h4>
            <p class="content-block__paragraph1">
              This intricate system involves multiple stages dedicated to skin, facial, and hair-related aspects, providing personalized recommendations for cosmetic products. The process commences by gathering data based on skin diseases and their severity, which is used to create models for identifying skin conditions and their seriousness using texture. The initial phase involves collecting pertinent information about skin diseases and severity to establish models capable of detecting skin issues and their level of severity. The subsequent stage follows a similar trajectory for facial data, encompassing the acquisition of facial skin condition-related data. This data is harnessed to construct models that can promptly detect faces in real-time video streams and ascertain facial skin conditions. Shifting the focus to hair-related aspects, the system amasses data centered around hair diseases and their severity, with texture and color as pivotal factors. This collected data forms the basis for fabricating models adept at recognizing hair ailments and gauging their severity. Advancing to the final phase, the accumulated information serves as the bedrock for providing personalized cosmetic product recommendations. To facilitate this, a model is developed to detect skin types, requiring the collection of skin type-based data. This data is further enriched with reviews of cosmetic products, which are subsequently integrated into a product recommendation model. The operational process of the system is deliberately designed to be user-friendly and efficient. In the event of a skin concern, users can capture an image of the affected area. The image data is inputted into the skin type identification model, which identifies the specific skin type, such as oily or dry. This information is combined with results from sub-objectives, including skin disease identification, severity assessment, and facial condition recognition. The amalgamated data is utilized by the cosmetic product recommendation model to propose the most suitable cosmetic product tailored to the individual's unique needs.

            The implementation of the hair disease detection model focuses on recognizing and examining facial images to identify prevalent hair-related conditions such as alopecia areata, dandruff, head lice, telogen effluvium, and tinea capitis. This model was built using convolutional neural networks, and the methodology entails gathering data specifically pertaining to hair diseases. This information is employed to develop the hair disease detection model based on both texture and color features. Users initiate the process by providing an image of their affected hair and scalp area. They then opt for the hair disease detection mode, which utilizes the hair disease detection model to identify potential hair diseases. If a potential hair disease is detected, the system further employs the detection model to assess the disease of the user's hair condition. This assessment is made by analyzing the texture and color of the affected area. Ultimately, the system presents the user with the name of the detected hair disease. The user is advised to seek appropriate medical attention based on these findings.
